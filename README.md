# Stircom-Campaign-Analysis

StirCom is a telecoms company that has spent the past few years digging up the 
streets of UK cities to connect people to their network. They are now keen to expand 
into the 5G market so they have been running a marketing campaign to encourage 
their existing landline customers to take out mobile contracts. Unfortunately, the call 
centre costs to run this campaign are high, so they would like to target customers 
more effectively to avoid wasted calls. This is where you come in. StirCom have 
provided data describing over 50000 customers and their responses to previous 
marketing campaigns. The data tells us if each customer responded to the marketing 
by setting up a new contract “new_contract_this_campaign”. The question is simple: is there any way to predict which customers are more likely to 
respond positively to a marketing call?
